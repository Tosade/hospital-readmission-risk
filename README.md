# hospital-readmission-risk

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes patient records from over 130 US hospitals to predict the likelihood of readmission within 30 days. The goal is to support healthcare providers in identifying at-risk patients early.

ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Hospital readmissions are costly and often preventable. Using demographic, diagnostic, and medication data, we build models to classify patients based on their readmission risk.
